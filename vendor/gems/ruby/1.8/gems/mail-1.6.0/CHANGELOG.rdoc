== Fri  8 Jan 2010 00:00:08 UTC Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

== Thu  5 Jan 2010 23:59:48 UTC Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Moving the require for tlsmail for Ruby 1.8.6 into mail.rb

== Sun Jan  3 00:08:06 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 1.5.0

* Major API change in Message#field_name.  This WILL break your applications that use Mail.  Message#field_name now returns good, intelligent, default values.  You can still access the field object by calling Message#[:field_name] or Message#['field_name'].

== Sat Jan  2 04:12:53 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Message-ID, Content-ID, References et al, now return the default value of the message ID without the angle brackets, as per RFC 2822, "Semantically, the angle bracket characters are not part of the msg-id; the msg-id is what is contained between the two angle bracket characters."

* Message class now has getter and setter methods for all the supported field types explicitly.  This allows us to return a "default" value for all fields.

* All address fields, when called from Message#to or Message#from or the like, return either a string of the address spec (mikel@test.lindsaar.net) if it is a single entry, or an array of address specs if there is more than one ['mikel@test.lindsaar.net', 'ada@test.lindsaar.net']

== Mon 28 Dec 2009 01:21:52 UTC Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Added sorting of parts, default is text/plain, then text/enriched and text/html.  Access through  Body#set_sort_order and Body#sort_parts! (called from Body#encode automatically)
* Version bump to 1.4.2

== Sun Dec 27 10:38:24 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Updating treetop and mail to initialize uninitialized instance variables to
  nil
* Version bump to 1.4.1

== Sun Dec 27 09:51:27 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 1.4 because now :to_s calls :decoded for all fields and body 
  while :to_s calls :encoded for Message and Header containers.  Makes sense... 
  really.

== Sun Dec 27 07:30:02 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Changed fields to default to :decoded on :to_s, all container objects
  retain :encoded as the default for :to_s

== Thu Dec 17 06:35:05 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Fixed parsing error 'Subject: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Re=3A_ol=E1?=' (has a new line embedded)

* Moved all of the Part init into the Message class.  Part now just uses Message's init,
  also moved all the attachment related functions into Message.  As Part is a subclass

* 2acb70a: Closes Issue #1 - Handling badly formatted content-type fields <mikel>

* Renamed Mail::Message.encode! to Mail::Message.ready_to_send!, deprecated :encode! <mikel>
* Rewrote encoding and decoding methods on all classes.  Adds a lot of boiler plate code, but allows us to
  be really precise in each field type that needs custom encoding.  Now all encoding is done by the field_type
  itself.  Need to follow through on the body. <mikel>
* Bump version to 1.2.0 due to changes of :encoded, :decoded behaviour <mikel>

== Tue Nov  3 00:59:45 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

content-disposition or content-location
